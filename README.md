# HW4_dyl30 README

This README file provides instructions for compiling and running the `HW4_dyl30` Java program, which demonstrates hashing techniques.

## Compiling the Program

To compile the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `HW4_dyl30.java` file using the `cd` command: 
cd /path/to/the/directory/with/java/file


Then compile the Java file with the `javac` command:
javac HW4_dyl30.java


This will generate a `HW4_dyl30.class` file in the same directory.

## Running the Program

To run the compiled program, execute it with the `java` command in the same directory:
java HW4_dyl30


This command will start the program and display the results of the hashing operations in the terminal window.

Remember to eplace /path/to/the/directory/with/java/file with the actual path where your Java file is located.
